/*
Answer:
C is correct. First of all, boxing takes care of the 
Boolean. Line 9 uses the modulus operator, 
which returns the remainder of the division, 
which in this case is 1. Also, line 9 sets b2 to false, 
and it doesn't test b2's value. Line 10 sets b2 to true, 
and it doesnâ€™t test its value; however, the short circuit
operator keeps the expression b2 = true from being executed.
A, B, D, and E are incorrect based on the above.

Ok No problem!
