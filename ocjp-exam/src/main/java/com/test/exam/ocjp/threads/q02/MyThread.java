//Answer:
//D is correct. The thread MyThread will start and loop three times (from 0 to 2).
//A is incorrect because the Thread class implements the Runnable interface; therefore, in line 5, 
//Thread can take an object of type Thread as an argument in the constructor (this is NOT recommended). 
//B and C are incorrect because the variable i in the for loop 
//starts with a value of 0 and ends with a value of 2. E is incorrect based on the above. (Obj. 4.1)
